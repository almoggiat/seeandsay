test.js
Is the frontend, static site, it send request to new backend
server (web service) with the new data it got (POST).
it sends it to the link of the backend service
(https://seeandsay-mongodb-backend.onrender.com/)
but, with specific "port": /api/saveUser

server.js
Is the backend web service, it has a listener at /api/saveUser
when request is coming it runs the code.

conclusion:
i can make more ports with listeners with my chosen "port"
